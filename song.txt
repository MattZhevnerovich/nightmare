The most beautiful thoughts are always besides the darkest
Today I seriously thought about killing you
I contemplated, premeditated murder
And I think about killing myself
And I love myself way more than I love you, so
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
You'd only care enough to kill somebody you love
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
Just say it out loud to see how it feels
People say, "Don't say this, don't say that"
Just say out loud, just to see how it feels
Weigh all the options, nothing's off the table
Today I thought about killing you, premeditated murder
I think about killing myself, and I, I love myself way more than I love you
The most beautiful thoughts are always beside the darkest
